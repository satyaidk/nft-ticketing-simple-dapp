#NFT-Based Ticketing System
NFT-based ticketing system and a React frontend to interact with it. 
Let's break this down into two parts: the smart contract and the frontend.

Let's begin with the Solidity smart contract:

```plaintext file="contracts/TicketNFT.sol"
...
```

Now, let's create a React frontend to interact with this smart contract:

```typescriptreact project="nft-ticketing"
...
```

This setup provides a basic NFT-based ticketing system with the following features:

1. A Solidity smart contract (`TicketNFT.sol`) that handles:

1. Creating events
2. Minting tickets as NFTs
3. Allowing ticket resale (structure in place, but needs further implementation)

2. A React frontend that allows users to:

1. Connect their Ethereum wallet
2. Create new events (if they're the contract owner)
3. View existing events
4. Purchase tickets for events

To use this system:

1. Deploy the Solidity contract to an Ethereum network (local testnet, public testnet, or mainnet).
2. Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE` in the `App.tsx` file with the address of your deployed contract.
3. Ensure you have MetaMask or another web3 wallet installed in your browser.
4. Run the React app and interact with the NFT ticketing system.

Note that this is a basic implementation and would need additional features for a production-ready system, such as:

- More robust error handling
- A proper resale marketplace
- Event management features (e.g., cancellation, rescheduling)
- User authentication and authorization
- Improved UI/UX design


You may also want to add testing for both the smart contract and the frontend, and consider using a development environment like Hardhat for easier contract deployment and testing.
